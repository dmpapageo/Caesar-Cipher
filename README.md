The Caesar Cipher is one of the earliest and simplest method of encryption. Itâ€™s a type of substitution cipher, therefore each letter of a given text is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. 
The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it to communicate with his officials.

This version of Caesar Cipher shifts backwards when passing a positive value at num_to_rotate_by, and forward when passing a negative value

Example:
Text : HELLO
Shift: 1
Cipher: GDKKN

Text : HELLO
Shift: -1
Cipher:IFMMP
